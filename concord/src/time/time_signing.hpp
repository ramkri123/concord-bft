// This header file includes the classes to be used by the time service for
// signing time samples (TimeSigner) and validating those
// signatures(TimeVerifier).
//
// At the time of this writing, we re-use replica RSA keys already in Concord's
// configuration for signing time samples in order to avoid needing to add more
// cryptographic keys to the configuration. We re-use the RSASigner and
// RSAVerifier for this purpose. Although these classes are from a source
// directory of Concord-BFT that we generally don't (and probably shouldn't)
// include from outside of Concord-BFT and these classes are themselves just
// fairly thin wrappers of crypto implementations from CryptoPP, we currently
// choose to go through the unsightliness of including them here because it is
// preferable to have this use of the RSA keys use the same signer/verifier
// classes as the keys' original use in case Concord-BFT later decides to change
// what RSA algorithms/parameters they are using from CryptoPP.
