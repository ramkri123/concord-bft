// Time Contract is a state machine run by each replica to combine timestamps
// from other replicas into a non-decreasing time that has some resilience to
// false readings.
//
// Readings are submitted as (source, time, signature) triples, where source is
// a string identifier of the submitter, time is an integer number of units
// since some starting point (units are unspecified, but milliseconds since the
// UNIX epoch is suggested) (See TimeContract::Update), and signature is a
// digital signature proving that this time sample actually originates from the
// named source (based on a public key given for that time source in this
// Concord cluster's configuration).
//
// Aggregation can be done via any statistical means that give the guarantees
// discussed above. The current implementation is to choose the median of the
// most recent readings. See TimeContract::SummarizeTime.
