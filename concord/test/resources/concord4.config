# [Concord configurations]

# All paths in this file are set up to make `./concord -c <this file>`
# work from the `build/` directory.

# Note: If same configuration option is also provided as command line parameter
# then the value provided in command line will take precedence over the value
# specified in configuration file.
# For example: With this configuration file if we run command as
#  ./concord --port 9999 --ip 192.168.0.1
# then concord will start listening on 192.168.0.1:9999 instead of 0.0.0.0:5458

# Ip on which to expose the service
ip=0.0.0.0
# port number on which to expose the servie
port=5461

# configuration file for logger
logger_config=./test/resources/log4cplus.properties
# Interval (in ms) to check for updates to logging properties files
logger_reconfig_time=60000


# Genesis block file to initialize the blockchain
# Please provide absolute path for genesis block file
genesis_block=./test/resources/genesis.json

# api worker pool size
api_worker_pool_size = 3

blockchain_db_impl=rocksdb
blockchain_db_path=rocksdbdata4/


# The maximum number of transactions concord will return when a transaction list
# request is made
